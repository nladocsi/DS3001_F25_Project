\section{Data:}
\label{submission}

The purpose of this project is to estimate the likelihood that an adult develops diabetes in the United States based on their basic demographic characteristics, as well as behavioral characteristics. The data used in this project are from the 2024 National Health Interview Survey (NHIS). This survey is conducted annually of US households and is used to monitor national health trends as well as inform public health policy. This survey collects data on a broad range of health-related information and uses a large representative sample of the U.S. population. Basic demographic characteristics include height, weight, age group, and BMI. Smoking, drinking, exercise habits are a few of the behavioral characteristics that will be explored later on in this project. Using survey data does come with limitations, there may be response or sampling bias. The National Health Interview Survey, since 1957, has conducted confidential face-to-face interviews throughout the year, which may help reduce response bias. Dividing the country into different geographic regions ensures a broad geographic coverage, and randomization also aids in procuring data from a representative sample.

The first step with any dataset, especially one this large, is to identify the key variables relating to the initial question. As diabetes is the primary focus of this project, variables related to factors that increase diabetes risk were highlighted. There are three main categories of diabetes found in the dataset: gestational, pre-diabetes, and type I and II. In the original dataset, these three variables are separate [GESDIB\_A, PREDIB\_A, DIBEV\_A]. To increase readability and facilitate drawing conclusions, the three variables will be combined into a single variable. This new variable will take numeric observations, with 1 indicating 'yes', 2 indicating 'no', 7 indicating 'refused', 8 indicating 'not ascertained', and 9 indicating 'don’t know'. Distinguishing between type I and type II diabetes will be included in another variable (DIBTYPE\_A) in the answer to the previous variable is 1. In addition, the age of the surveyor when they were first diagnosed with diabetes will have its own variable DIBAGETC\_A.

The outlined variables above gather information about the surveyor's diagnosis of diabetes. Since the goal is also to examine contributing factors to mitigate diabetes risk, the predictor variables also need to be included. One broad category is food insecurity, which contains the variables: [FDSRUNOUT\_A worry food would run out, FDSLAST\_A food didn't last, FDSHUNGRY\_ A hungry because not enough money for food]. Further analysis may reveal which of the variables among the three should be prioritized, or if all are relevant. Additionally, demographic characteristics will be analyzed. These include sex (SEX\_A), home location (REGION), race/ethnicity (RACEALLP\_A), income level (RATCAT\_A), education level of sample adults (EDUCP\_A). Lastly, physical lifestyle habits will also be factored through physical activity (MONDNR\_A), and weekly walking (WLKEISDAY\_A). 

The data used were obtained from a survey; therefore, not all surveyors answered every question. In addition, those surveyed may not have been entirely truthful or provided accurate information. This leaves us with NA values that will need to be wrangled before we begin data analysis. Therefore, conclusions can be drawn but cannot be claimed with absolute certainty. This data set has hundreds of variables, so we will remove many variables that we believe to be insignificant. We need to do testing to ensure that we remove the correct ones. 

\subsection{Pre-Analysis Plan}



\medskip

As outlined in our Data Description, the goal is to develop a model that can classify whether or not a person has diabetes in the United States, based on demographic and behavioral information. Within the data set, information about numerous aspects of the surveyor is outlined, including whether or not they have diabetes. Through training the model and establishing correlation patterns, the goal is to create a model that can estimate whether or not one is likely to develop diabetes depending on the information entered. The demographic variables include food insecurity, sex, region, race/ethnicity, income level, and level level of education terms of a patient’s lifestyle, the variables included in the data examine physical activity and weekly walking habits. 

After cleaning, organizing, and wrangling the data, we first plan to analyze the data using exploratory data analysis methods. During this step we will be able to grow our understanding of the correlation each variable has to diabetes before modeling. Within this step we will cross-tabulate diabetes with several of the other variables to show relationships and patterns within the categorical data. Furthermore, the use of bar plots will allow us to identify outliers for our variables, and give insight into which variables should be scaled. Overall, this initial exploratory step will help us decide which variables are significant enough to include in our next modeling step of analysis. 

Once the variables of our analysis are explored we plan to use a decision tree model for further analysis. Due to the complexity of our data and the multitude of factors influencing the diabetic outcome of the patient, we felt this was the most appropriate model to use. A decision tree will be compatible with the lack of quantitative or numeric data in our dataset. Trees are also non-reliant on linear relationships which we are not likely to see in our data. The tree itself will provide an easily interpretable visualization of the decision-making pathway. However, since decision trees output a categorical variable, we will have to encode or determine some threshold with diabetes being a yes or no.

In order to accomplish this, we first have to encode the categorical variables using one-hot encoding or pd.get\_dummies(). The tree model can’t handle text labels directly so converting these labels into a numeric form allows the model to run successfully. Next it is integral to split the data into train and test sets to give the model the ability to generalize. Allowing performance not just on the given data, but predicting for unseen, future data. We will split the data 80/20 into train and test sets respectively training the model. After the visualization, we will choose to check the model’s accuracy using the confusion matrix method which depicts how the model’s predictions match the actual outcomes. From there, R\textsuperscript{2} and RMSE values will be calculated to evaluate the model and determine if changes need to be implemented. One of the biggest concerns with the decision tree model is overfitting which can occur if the model is split too many times. Especially with complex data, we will most likely have to prune the tree to generalize the model. 


\subsection{Submitting Final Camera-Ready Copy}

The final versions of papers accepted for publication should follow the
same format and naming convention as initial submissions, except that
author information (names and affiliations) should be given. See
\cref{final author} for formatting instructions.

The footnote, ``Preliminary work. Under review by the International
Conference on Machine Learning (ICML). Do not distribute.'' must be
modified to ``\textit{Proceedings of the
$\mathit{42}^{nd}$ International Conference on Machine Learning},
Vancouver, Canada, PMLR 267, 2025.
Copyright 2025 by the author(s).''

For those using the \textbf{\LaTeX} style file, this change (and others) is
handled automatically by simply changing
$\mathtt{\backslash usepackage\{icml2025\}}$ to
$$\mathtt{\backslash usepackage[accepted]\{icml2025\}}$$
Authors using \textbf{Word} must edit the
footnote on the first page of the document themselves.

Camera-ready copies should have the title of the paper as running head
on each page except the first one. The running title consists of a
single line centered above a horizontal rule which is $1$~point thick.
The running head should be centered, bold and in $9$~point type. The
rule should be $10$~points above the main text. For those using the
\textbf{\LaTeX} style file, the original title is automatically set as running
head using the \texttt{fancyhdr} package which is included in the ICML
2025 style file package. In case that the original title exceeds the
size restrictions, a shorter form can be supplied by using

\verb|\icmltitlerunning{...}|

just before $\mathtt{\backslash begin\{document\}}$.
Authors using \textbf{Word} must edit the header of the document themselves.

\section{Format of the Paper}

All submissions must follow the specified format.

\subsection{Dimensions}




The text of the paper should be formatted in two columns, with an
overall width of 6.75~inches, height of 9.0~inches, and 0.25~inches
between the columns. The left margin should be 0.75~inches and the top
margin 1.0~inch (2.54~cm). The right and bottom margins will depend on
whether you print on US letter or A4 paper, but all final versions
must be produced for US letter size.
Do not write anything on the margins.

The paper body should be set in 10~point type with a vertical spacing
of 11~points. Please use Times typeface throughout the text.

\subsection{Title}

The paper title should be set in 14~point bold type and centered
between two horizontal rules that are 1~point thick, with 1.0~inch
between the top rule and the top edge of the page. Capitalize the
first letter of content words and put the rest of the title in lower
case.

\subsection{Author Information for Submission}
\label{author info}

ICML uses double-blind review, so author information must not appear. If
you are using \LaTeX\/ and the \texttt{icml2025.sty} file, use
\verb+\icmlauthor{...}+ to specify authors and \verb+\icmlaffiliation{...}+ to specify affiliations. (Read the TeX code used to produce this document for an example usage.) The author information
will not be printed unless \texttt{accepted} is passed as an argument to the
style file.
Submissions that include the author information will not
be reviewed.

\subsubsection{Self-Citations}

If you are citing published papers for which you are an author, refer
to yourself in the third person. In particular, do not use phrases
that reveal your identity (e.g., ``in previous work \cite{langley00}, we
have shown \ldots'').

Do not anonymize citations in the reference section. The only exception are manuscripts that are
not yet published (e.g., under submission). If you choose to refer to
such unpublished manuscripts \cite{anonymous}, anonymized copies have
to be submitted
as Supplementary Material via OpenReview\@. However, keep in mind that an ICML
paper should be self contained and should contain sufficient detail
for the reviewers to evaluate the work. In particular, reviewers are
not required to look at the Supplementary Material when writing their
review (they are not required to look at more than the first $8$ pages of the submitted document).

\subsubsection{Camera-Ready Author Information}
\label{final author}

If a paper is accepted, a final camera-ready copy must be prepared.
%
For camera-ready papers, author information should start 0.3~inches below the
bottom rule surrounding the title. The authors' names should appear in 10~point
bold type, in a row, separated by white space, and centered. Author names should
not be broken across lines. Unbolded superscripted numbers, starting 1, should
be used to refer to affiliations.

Affiliations should be numbered in the order of appearance. A single footnote
block of text should be used to list all the affiliations. (Academic
affiliations should list Department, University, City, State/Region, Country.
Similarly for industrial affiliations.)

Each distinct affiliations should be listed once. If an author has multiple
affiliations, multiple superscripts should be placed after the name, separated
by thin spaces. If the authors would like to highlight equal contribution by
multiple first authors, those authors should have an asterisk placed after their
name in superscript, and the term ``\textsuperscript{*}Equal contribution"
should be placed in the footnote block ahead of the list of affiliations. A
list of corresponding authors and their emails (in the format Full Name
\textless{}email@domain.com\textgreater{}) can follow the list of affiliations.
Ideally only one or two names should be listed.

A sample file with author names is included in the ICML2025 style file
package. Turn on the \texttt{[accepted]} option to the stylefile to
see the names rendered. All of the guidelines above are implemented
by the \LaTeX\ style file.

\subsection{Abstract}

The paper abstract should begin in the left column, 0.4~inches below the final
address. The heading `Abstract' should be centered, bold, and in 11~point type.
The abstract body should use 10~point type, with a vertical spacing of
11~points, and should be indented 0.25~inches more than normal on left-hand and
right-hand margins. Insert 0.4~inches of blank space after the body. Keep your
abstract brief and self-contained, limiting it to one paragraph and roughly 4--6
sentences. Gross violations will require correction at the camera-ready phase.

\subsection{Partitioning the Text}

You should organize your paper into sections and paragraphs to help
readers place a structure on the material and understand its
contributions.

\subsubsection{Sections and Subsections}

Section headings should be numbered, flush left, and set in 11~pt bold
type with the content words capitalized. Leave 0.25~inches of space
before the heading and 0.15~inches after the heading.

Similarly, subsection headings should be numbered, flush left, and set
in 10~pt bold type with the content words capitalized. Leave
0.2~inches of space before the heading and 0.13~inches afterward.

Finally, subsubsection headings should be numbered, flush left, and
set in 10~pt small caps with the content words capitalized. Leave
0.18~inches of space before the heading and 0.1~inches after the
heading.

Please use no more than three levels of headings.

\subsubsection{Paragraphs and Footnotes}

Within each section or subsection, you should further partition the
paper into paragraphs. Do not indent the first line of a given
paragraph, but insert a blank line between succeeding ones.

You can use footnotes\footnote{Footnotes
should be complete sentences.} to provide readers with additional
information about a topic without interrupting the flow of the paper.
Indicate footnotes with a number in the text where the point is most
relevant. Place the footnote in 9~point type at the bottom of the
column in which it appears. Precede the first footnote in a column
with a horizontal rule of 0.8~inches.\footnote{Multiple footnotes can
appear in each column, in the same order as they appear in the text,
but spread them across columns and pages if possible.}

produced, the number of accepted papers for ICML 2008 was unknown and instead
estimated.}
\label{icml-historical}
\end{center}
\vskip -0.2in
\end{figure}

\subsection{Figures}

You may want to include figures in the paper to illustrate
your approach and results. Such artwork should be centered,
legible, and separated from the text. Lines should be dark and at
least 0.5~points thick for purposes of reproduction, and text should
not appear on a gray background.

Label all distinct components of each figure. If the figure takes the
form of a graph, then give a name for each axis and include a legend
that briefly describes each curve. Do not include a title inside the
figure; instead, the caption should serve this function.

Number figures sequentially, placing the figure number and caption
\emph{after} the graphics, with at least 0.1~inches of space before
the caption and 0.1~inches after it, as in
\cref{icml-historical}. The figure caption should be set in
9~point type and centered unless it runs two or more lines, in which
case it should be flush left. You may float figures to the top or
bottom of a column, and you may set wide figures across both columns
(use the environment \texttt{figure*} in \LaTeX). Always place
two-column figures at the top or bottom of the page.

\subsection{Algorithms}

If you are using \LaTeX, please use the ``algorithm'' and ``algorithmic''
environments to format pseudocode. These require
the corresponding stylefiles, algorithm.sty and
algorithmic.sty, which are supplied with this package.
\cref{alg:example} shows an example.

\begin{algorithm}[tb]
   \caption{Bubble Sort}
   \label{alg:example}
\begin{algorithmic}
   \STATE {\bfseries Input:} data $x_i$, size $m$
   \REPEAT
   \STATE Initialize $noChange = true$.
   \FOR{$i=1$ {\bfseries to} $m-1$}
   \IF{$x_i > x_{i+1}$}
   \STATE Swap $x_i$ and $x_{i+1}$
   \STATE $noChange = false$
   \ENDIF
   \ENDFOR
   \UNTIL{$noChange$ is $true$}
\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

\subsection{Tables}

You may also want to include tables that summarize material. Like
figures, these should be centered, legible, and numbered consecutively.
However, place the title \emph{above} the table with at least
0.1~inches of space before the title and the same after it, as in
\cref{sample-table}. The table title should be set in 9~point
type and centered unless it runs two or more lines, in which case it
should be flush left.

% Note use of \abovespace and \belowspace to get reasonable spacing
% above and below tabular lines.

\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{sc}
\end{small}
\end{center}
\vskip -0.1in
\end{table}

Tables contain textual material, whereas figures contain graphical material.
Specify the contents of each row and column in the table's topmost
row. Again, you may float tables to a column's top or bottom, and set
wide tables across both columns. Place two-column tables at the
top or bottom of the page.

\subsection{Theorems and such}
The preferred way is to number definitions, propositions, lemmas, etc. consecutively, within sections, as shown below.
\begin{definition}
\label{def:inj}
A function $f:X \to Y$ is injective if for any $x,y\in X$ different, $f(x)\ne f(y)$.
\end{definition}
Using \cref{def:inj} we immediate get the following result:
\begin{proposition}
If $f$ is injective mapping a set $X$ to another set $Y$, 
the cardinality of $Y$ is at least as large as that of $X$
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof} 
Left as an exercise to the reader. 
\end{proof}
\cref{lem:usefullemma} stated next will prove to be useful.
\begin{lemma}
\label{lem:usefullemma}
For any $f:X \to Y$ and $g:Y\to Z$ injective functions, $f \circ g$ is injective.
\end{lemma}
\begin{theorem}
\label{thm:bigtheorem}
If $f:X\to Y$ is bijective, the cardinality of $X$ and $Y$ are the same.
\end{theorem}
An easy corollary of \cref{thm:bigtheorem} is the following:
\begin{corollary}
If $f:X\to Y$ is bijective, 
the cardinality of $X$ is at least as large as that of $Y$.
\end{corollary}
\begin{assumption}
The set $X$ is finite.
\label{ass:xfinite}
\end{assumption}
\begin{remark}
According to some, it is only the finite case (cf. \cref{ass:xfinite}) that is interesting.
\end{remark}
%restatable

\subsection{Citations and References}

Please use APA reference format regardless of your formatter
or word processor. If you rely on the \LaTeX\/ bibliographic
facility, use \texttt{natbib.sty} and \texttt{icml2025.bst}
included in the style-file package to obtain this format.

Citations within the text should include the authors' last names and
year. If the authors' names are included in the sentence, place only
the year in parentheses, for example when referencing Arthur Samuel's
pioneering work \yrcite{Samuel59}. Otherwise place the entire
reference in parentheses with the authors and year separated by a
comma \cite{Samuel59}. List multiple references separated by
semicolons \cite{kearns89,Samuel59,mitchell80}. Use the `et~al.'
construct only for citations with three or more authors or after
listing all authors to a publication in an earlier reference \cite{MachineLearningI}.

Authors should cite their own work in the third person
in the initial version of their paper submitted for blind review.
Please refer to \cref{author info} for detailed instructions on how to
cite your own papers.

Use an unnumbered first-level section heading for the references, and use a
hanging indent style, with the first line of the reference flush against the
left margin and subsequent lines indented by 10 points. The references at the
end of this document give examples for journal articles \cite{Samuel59},
conference publications \cite{langley00}, book chapters \cite{Newell81}, books
\cite{DudaHart2nd}, edited volumes \cite{MachineLearningI}, technical reports
\cite{mitchell80}, and dissertations \cite{kearns89}.

Alphabetize references by the surnames of the first authors, with
single author entries preceding multiple author entries. Order
references for the same authors by year of publication, with the
earliest first. Make sure that each reference includes all relevant
information (e.g., page numbers).

Please put some effort into making references complete, presentable, and
consistent, e.g. use the actual current name of authors.
If using bibtex, please protect capital letters of names and
abbreviations in titles, for example, use \{B\}ayesian or \{L\}ipschitz
in your .bib file.

\section*{Accessibility}
Authors are kindly asked to make their submissions as accessible as possible for everyone including people with disabilities and sensory or neurological differences.
Tips of how to achieve this and what to pay attention to will be provided on the conference website \url{http://icml.cc/}.

\section*{Software and Data}

If a paper is accepted, we strongly encourage the publication of software and data with the
camera-ready version of the paper whenever appropriate. This can be
done by including a URL in the camera-ready copy. However, \textbf{do not}
include URLs that reveal your institution or identity in your
submission for review. Instead, provide an anonymous URL or upload
the material as ``Supplementary Material'' into the OpenReview reviewing
system. Note that reviewers are not required to look at this material
when writing their review.

% Acknowledgements should only appear in the accepted version.
\section*{Acknowledgements}

\textbf{Do not} include acknowledgements in the initial version of
the paper submitted for blind review.

If a paper is accepted, the final camera-ready version can (and
usually should) include acknowledgements.  Such acknowledgements
should be placed at the end of the section, in an unnumbered section
that does not count towards the paper page limit. Typically, this will 
include thanks to reviewers who gave useful comments, to colleagues 
who contributed to the ideas, and to funding agencies and corporate 
sponsors that provided financial support.

\section*{Impact Statement}

Authors are \textbf{required} to include a statement of the potential 
broader impact of their work, including its ethical aspects and future 
societal consequences. This statement should be in an unnumbered 
section at the end of the paper (co-located with Acknowledgements -- 
the two may appear in either order, but both must be before References), 
and does not count toward the paper page limit. In many cases, where 
the ethical impacts and expected societal implications are those that 
are well established when advancing the field of Machine Learning, 
substantial discussion is not required, and a simple statement such 
as the following will suffice:

``This paper presents work whose goal is to advance the field of 
Machine Learning. There are many potential societal consequences 
of our work, none which we feel must be specifically highlighted here.''

The above statement can be used verbatim in such cases, but we 
encourage authors to think about whether there is content which does 
warrant further discussion, as this statement will be apparent if the 
paper is later flagged for ethics review.


% In the unusual situation where you want a paper to appear in the
% references without citing it in the main text, use \nocite
